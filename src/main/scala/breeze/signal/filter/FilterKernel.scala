  /** FIR filter design using the window method.

    This function computes the coefficients of a finite impulse response
    filter.  The filter will have linear phase; it will be Type I if
  `numtaps` is odd and Type II if `numtaps` is even.

    Type II filters always have zero response at the Nyquist rate, so a
    ValueError exception is raised if firwin is called with `numtaps` even and
  having a passband whose right end is at the Nyquist rate.

    @param cutoff Cutoff frequencies of the filter, specified in units of "nyquist."
                  The frequencies should all be positive and monotonically increasing.
                  The frequencies must lie between (0, nyquist).
                  0 and nyquist should not be included in this array.

    @param optWindow Currently supports a hamming window [[breeze.signal.OptWindowFunction.Hamming]],
                  a specified window [[breeze.signal.OptWindowFunction.User]], or
                  no window [[breeze.signal.OptWindowFunction.None]].
    @param zeroPass If true (default), the gain at frequency 0 (ie the "DC gain") is 1, if false, 0.
    @param scale Whether to scale the coefficiency so that frequency response is unity at either (A) 0 if zeroPass is true
                 or (B) at nyquist if the first passband ends at nyquist, or (C) the center of the first passband. Default is true.
    @param nyquist The nyquist frequency, default is 1.
