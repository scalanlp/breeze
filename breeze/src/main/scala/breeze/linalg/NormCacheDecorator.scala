/**
 * This decorator automatically caches the norm and sums of a vector and invalidates the cache whenever the vector is updated.  It can be
 * applied to any {@code Vector} such as {@code DenseVector} or {@code SparseVector}.  Calls for the norm or sum after the initial request
 * will have a O(1) run time.  Calls to {@code update} will have a slight constant overhead used to invalidate the cache.  This wrapper is
 * especially beneficial for vectors that are rarely updated but frequently use the aggregate values, such as in cosine similarity.  
 *
 * </p>
 * Note that changing the backing datastructure of the {@code Vector} without using {@code update} will produce undefined behavior.
