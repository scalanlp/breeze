# Breeze 

Breeze is a library for numerical processing. Its primary focus is on being generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The current version is 0.4-SNAPSHOT. The library currently consists of several parts: 

* breeze-math: Linear algebra and numerics routines
* breeze-viz: Vizualization and plotting (this is going away soon)

Note: after the recent reorganization, breeze-learn (machine learning) is now in [Nak](https://github.com/scalanlp/nak) and breeze-process (natural language processing) has become [Chalk](https://github.com/scalanlp/chalk).

## Build

This project can be built with sbt 0.12.3

## History

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because  one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
