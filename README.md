# Breeze 

Breeze is a library for numerical processing, machine learning, and natural language processing.
Its primary focus is on being generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The current version is 0.4-SNAPSHOT. The library currently consists of several parts: 

* breeze-math: Linear algebra and numerics routines
* breeze-process: Libraries for managing datasets and job pipelines.
* breeze-learn: Machine Learning and Optimization.
* breeze-viz: Vizualization and plotting

Possible future releases:

* breeze-fst: Finite state toolkit

## Build

This project can be built with sbt 0.11.2

## History

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because  one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
